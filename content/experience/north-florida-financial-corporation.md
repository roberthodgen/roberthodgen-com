As the sole "tech guy" at a 200-person company the job was demanding. I had to balance the support needs of my co-workers with the technological requirements of security and connectivity.

Luckily I discovered my appreciation for programming as a profession at North Florida Financial when I begun to maintain and modify some internal tools. These were written in PHP and ran on the _LAMP stack_ (Linux Apache, MySQL, PHP). Prior to this point I programmed just for fun.
