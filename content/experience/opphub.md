Co-founder and builder of cool.

<!--more-->

As the technical co-founder I was responsible for building the platform during the summer of 2014. We launched our _MVP_ (minimum viable product) at the end of summer on schedule.

Taking the technologies I was already familar with, namely PHP, I built the offering to run on Google's AppEngine backed by their CloudSQL offering.

Leveraging my existing knowledge of JavaScript I built a modern front-end using AngularJS 1.
